    'lived in unity. They shared\nknowledge of their ancestors '\
    'and the way of life between each other. Until\none day '\
    'dark elves decided that warriors and mages are beneath '\
    'them. Dark\nelves migrated away from the warriors and mages '\
    'into the mountains. For many\nyears, they stick for '\
    'themselves, but their resources were running low so\nthey '\
    'started raiding villages of warriors and mages. '\
    'Stealing their food,\nwomen and man for slaves. '\
    'One day, they have crossed the line.....\n\n'

COWARD = '“I am sorry, but I can not help you”. You go back to '\

    'the footprints on the path and you know these are from the '\
    'dark\nelves because of the shape of them. Only three toes '\
    'and double the size of\nyour own. You follow the footprints '\
    'and all of a sudden, something jumps on\nyou from the bushes. '\
    'You manage to fight it and toss it away from you onto\nthe '\
    'footpath. Great big eyes are staring at you with fangs as long '\
    'and sharp\nas butcher\'s knife. It is a python and you realize '\

    '“Greetings, stranger. If you wonder to far from your home,'\
    '\nyou might never go back.” cold and shaky voice says and '\

    'took the princess Astrid.\nCan you let me pass, please?” '\
